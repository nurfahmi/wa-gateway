# Cursor AI Rules for WA-Gateway Project

## File Creation Rules

### Markdown Files
- **NEVER** create, write, or modify markdown (.md) files unless the user explicitly asks for it
- This includes README files, documentation files, and any other .md files
- Only create/modify .md files when the user specifically requests it with clear intent (e.g., "create a README", "update the documentation", "write a markdown file")
- If suggesting documentation changes, only describe what should be changed without actually modifying the files

### General Guidelines
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Focus on code implementation rather than documentation unless requested
- When completing tasks, avoid proactively creating supporting documentation
